          This template will not be used directly, as we are using an aggregation policy.
    policy:
      # The `aggregation` policy collects all matches that occur within a time
      # window and sends a single, consolidated notification.
      aggregation:
        # The duration of the aggregation window in seconds.
        # All matches for a given monitor within this period will be grouped.
        window_secs: 300 # 5 minutes
        # The template for the aggregated notification.
        # This template has access to a `matches` array, which contains all the
        # `MonitorMatch` objects collected during the window.
        template:
          title: "Event Summary for {{ monitor_name }}"
          # You can iterate over the `matches` or use filters like `length`.
          body: |
            Detected {{ matches | length }} WBTC transfers by monitor {{ monitor_name }}.
            Total value: {{ matches | map(attribute='log.params.value') | sum | wbtc }} WBTC
            Average value: {{ matches | map(attribute='log.params.value') | avg | wbtc }} WBTC
